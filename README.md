# Customer Churn Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project to predict customer churn using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## About

This project predicts which customers are likely to leave (churn) so businesses can take action to retain them. It combines data analysis, SQL-based feature engineering, machine learning models, and interactive dashboards for actionable insights.

## Tech Stack

**Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
**SQL:** Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions  
**Power BI:** KPI cards, Slicers, Drill-down insights  
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## Features

- Predict customer churn with machine learning
- SQL-based data transformation and feature engineering
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights
- Identify key factors driving customer churn
- Compare multiple ML models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- SQL database
- Power BI Desktop

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasannabarge/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Data Processing**
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` folder
   - Run SQL queries from `sql/` folder for data transformation

2. **Model Training**
   - Execute Python scripts in `scripts/` folder
   - Train and evaluate different ML models

3. **Dashboard**
   - Open Power BI file for interactive visualizations
   - Analyze churn patterns and key metrics

## Key Insights

- Contract type is the strongest predictor of churn
- First 6 months are critical for customer retention
- Monthly charges and service quality impact churn rate
- SQL window functions help identify usage trends

## Results

The project implements multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to achieve accurate churn predictions.
